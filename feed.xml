Using a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack&quot;&gt;person-in-the-middle attack&lt;/a&gt;, anyone in the same network can insert malicious code into the library, and with that into your application, as a result running in your user’s pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt; of the most popular closed-source iOS SDKs are vulnerable to this attack, as well as a total of &lt;strong&gt;623 libraries&lt;/strong&gt; on CocoaPods. As part of this research I notified the affected parties, and submitted patches to CocoaPods to warn developers and SDK providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-potential-consequences-of-a-modified-sdk&quot;&gt;What are the potential consequences of a modified SDK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s extremely dangerous if someone modifies an SDK before you install it. You are shipping your app with that code/binary. It will run on thousands or millions of devices within a few days, and everything you ship within your app runs with the &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt; same privileges as your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means any SDK you include in your app has access to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same keychain your app has access to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any folders/files your app has access to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any app permissions your app has, e.g. location data, photo library access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iCloud containers of your app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All data your app exchanges with a web server, e.g. user logins, personal information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple enforces iOS app sandboxing for good reasons, so don’t forget that &lt;strong&gt;any SDK you include in your app runs inside your app’s sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;, and has access to everything your app has access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the worst that a malicious SDK could do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steal sensitive user data, basically add a keylogger for your app, and record every tap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steal keys and user’s credentials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-detectlocation-an-easy-way-to-access-the-users-ios-location-data-without-actually-having-access&quot;&gt;Access the user’s historic location data and sell it to third parties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-stealpassword-easily-get-the-users-apple-id-password-just-by-asking&quot;&gt;Show phishing pop-ups for iCloud, or other login credentials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-watchuser-access-both-iphone-cameras-any-time-your-app-is-running&quot;&gt;Take pictures in the background without telling the user&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack described here shows how an attacker can use &lt;strong&gt;your mobile app&lt;/strong&gt; to steal sensitive user data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-security-101&quot;&gt;Web Security 101&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how malicious code can be bundled into your app without your permission or awareness, I will provide necessary background to understanding how a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack&quot;&gt;MITM attack&lt;/a&gt; works and how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information below is vastly simplified, as I try to describe things in a way that a mobile developer without too much network knowledge can get a sense of how things work and how they can protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;https-vs-http&quot;&gt;HTTPs vs HTTP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP&lt;/strong&gt;: Unencrypted traffic, anybody in the same network (WiFi or Ethernet) can easily listen to the packets. It’s very straightforward to do on unencrypted WiFi networks, but it’s actually almost as easy to do so on a protected WiFi or Ethernet network. There is no way for your computer to verify the packets came from the host you requested data from; Other computers can receive packets before you, open and modify them and send the modified version to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPs&lt;/strong&gt;: With HTTPs traffic other hosts in the network can still listen to your packets, but can’t open them. They still get some basic metadata like the host name, but no details (like the body, full URL, …). Additionally your client also verifies that the packets came from the original host and that no one on the way there modified the content. HTTPs is based on TLS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-a-browser-switches-from-http-to-https&quot;&gt;How a browser switches from HTTP to HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter “&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;http://google.com&lt;/a&gt;” in your web browser (make sure to use “http”, not “https”). You’ll see how the browser automatically switches from the unsafe “http” protocol to “https”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This switch doesn’t happen in your browser but comes from the remote server (google.com), as your client (in this case the browser) can’t know what kind of protocol is supported by the host. (Exception for hosts that make use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security&quot;&gt;HSTS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial request happens via “http”, so the server has no choice but to respond in clear text “http” to tell the client to switch over to the secure “https” protocol with a “301 Moved Permanently” response code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably already see the problem here: since the response is being sent in clear text also, an attacker can modify that particular packet and replace the redirect destination URL to stay unencrypted “http”. This is called SSL Stripping, and we’ll talk more about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-network-requests-work&quot;&gt;How network requests work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very simplified, network requests work on multiple layers. Depending on the layer, different information is available on how to route a packet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lowest layer (Data Link Layer) uses MAC addresses to identify hosts in a network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The layer above (Network Layer) uses IP addresses to identify hosts in the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The layers above add port information and the actual message content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, you can learn how the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model works, in particular the implementation TCP/IP (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://microchipdeveloper.com/tcpip:tcp-ip-five-layer-model&quot;&gt;http://microchipdeveloper.com/tcpip:tcp-ip-five-layer-model&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if your computer now sends a packet to the router, how does the router know where to route the packet based on the first layer (MAC addresses)? To solve this problem, the router uses a protocol called ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-arp-works-and-how-it-can-be-abused&quot;&gt;How ARP works and how it can be abused&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplified, the devices in a network use ARP mapping to remember where to send packets of a certain MAC address. The way ARP works is simple: if a device wants to know where to send a packet for a certain IP address, it asks everyone in the network: “Which MAC address belongs to this IP?”. The device with that IP then replies to this message ✋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_1.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no way for a device to authenticate the sender of an ARP message. Therefore an attacker can be fast in responding to ARP announcements sent by another device, basically saying: “Hey, please send all packets that should go to IP address X to this MAC address”. The router will remember that and use that information for all future requests. This is called “ARP poisoning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_2.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how all packets are now routed through the attacker instead of going directly from the remote host to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the packets go through the attacker’s machine there is some risk. It’s the same risk you have when trusting your ISP or a VPN service: if the services you use are properly encrypted, they can’t really know details about what you’re doing or modify packets without your client (e.g. browser) noticing. As mentioned before there is still basic information that will always be visible such as certain metadata (e.g. the host name).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are web packets that are unencrypted (say HTTP) the attacker can not only look inside and read their content, but can also modify anything in there with no way of detecting the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the technique described above is different from what you might have read about the security issues with public WiFi networks. Public WiFis are a problem because everybody can just read whatever packets are flying through the air, and if they’re unencrypted HTTP, it’s easy to read what’s happening. ARP pollution works on any network, no matter if public or not, or if WiFi or ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-see-this-in-action&quot;&gt;Let’s see this in action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look into some SDKs and how they distribute their files, and see if we can find something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cocoapods&quot;&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open source Pods&lt;/strong&gt;: CocoaPods uses git under the hood to download code from code hosting services like GitHub. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git://&lt;/code&gt; protocol uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh://&lt;/code&gt;, which is similarly encrypted to HTTPs. In general, if you use CocoaPods to install open source SDKs from GitHub, you’re pretty safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closed source Pods&lt;/strong&gt;: When preparing this blog post, I noticed that Pods can define a HTTP URL to reference binary SDKs, so I submitted multiple pull requests (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/7249&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/7250&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) that got merged and released with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.4.0/&quot;&gt;CocoaPods 1.4.0&lt;/a&gt; to show warnings when a Pod uses unencrypted http.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crashlytics-sdk&quot;&gt;Crashlytics SDK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crashlytics uses CocoaPods as the default distribution, but has 2 alternative installation methods: the Fabric Mac app and manual installation, which are both https encrypted, so not much we can do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;localytics&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.localytics.com/dev/ios.html&quot;&gt;Localytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a sample SDK, the docs page is unencrypted via http (see the address bar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you might think: “Ah, I’m just reading the docs here, I don’t care if it’s unencrypted”. The problem here is that the download link (in blue) is also transferred as part of the website, meaning an attacker can easily replace the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; link with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;, making the actual file download unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively an attacker could just switch the https:// link to the attacker’s URL that looks similar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/localytics-sdk-docs/sdk.zip&quot;&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/localytics-sdk/sdk.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/localytics-sdk-docs/sdk.zip&quot;&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/localytics-sdk-binaries/sdk.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is no good way for the user to verify that the specific host, URL or S3 bucket belongs to the author of the SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To verify this I’ve set up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry PI&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the traffic and do various SSL Stripping (downgrading of HTTPS connections to HTTP) across the board, from JavaScript files, to image resources and of course download links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the download link was downgraded to HTTP, it’s easy to replace the content of the zip file as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing HTML text on the fly is pretty easy, but how can an attacker replace the content of a zip file or binary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The attacker downloads the original SDK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The attacker inserts malicious code into the SDK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The attacker compresses the modified SDK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The attacker looks at packets coming by, and jumps in to replace any zip file matching a certain pattern with the file the attacker prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is the same approach used by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/MITM_Labs/Bettercap_to_Replace_Images&quot;&gt;image replacement trick&lt;/a&gt;: Every image that’s transferred via HTTP gets replaced by a meme)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the downloaded SDK might include additional files or code that was modified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this attack to work, the requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The attacker is in the same network as you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The docs page is unencrypted and allows SSL Stripping on all links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_7.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Localytics resolved the issue after disclosing it, so both the docs page, and the actual download are now HTTPs encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;askingpoint&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.askingpoint.com/documentation-ios-sdk/&quot;&gt;AskingPoint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the next SDK, we have a HTTPs encrypted docs page, looking at the screenshot, this looks secure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the HTTPs based website links to an unencrypted HTTP file, and web browsers don’t warn users in those cases (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content&quot;&gt;some browsers already show a warning if JS/CSS files are downloaded via HTTP&lt;/a&gt;). It’s almost impossible for the user to detect that something is going on here, except if they were to actually manually compare the hashes provided. As part of this project, I filed a security report for both Google Chrome (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=794830&quot;&gt;794830&lt;/a&gt;) and Safari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5000976083714048&quot;&gt;rdar://36039748&lt;/a&gt;) to warn the user of unencrypted file downloads on HTTPs sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aws-sdk&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/&quot;&gt;AWS SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I was conducting this research, the AWS iOS SDK download page was HTTPs encrypted, however linked to a non-encrypted zip download, similarly to the SDKs mentioned before. The issue has been resolved after disclosing it to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking back about the iOS privacy vulnerabilities mentioned before (iCloud phishing, location access through pictures, accessing camera in background), what if we’re not talking about evil developers trying to trick their users… What if we talk about attackers that &lt;strong&gt;target you, the iOS developer&lt;/strong&gt;, to reach millions of users within a short amount of time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attacking-the-developer&quot;&gt;Attacking the developer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if an SDK gets modified as you download it using a person-in-the-middle attack, and inserts malicious code that breaks the user’s trust? Let’s take the iCloud phishing popup as an example, how hard would it be to use apps from other app developers to steal passwords from the user for you, and send them to your remote server?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video below you can see a sample iOS app that shows a mapview. After downloading and adding the AWS SDK to the project, you can see how malicious code is being executed, in this case an iCloud phishing popup is shown and the cleartext iCloud password can be accessed and sent to any remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Mx2oFCyWg2A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only requirement for this particular attack to work is that the attacker is in the same network as you (e.g. stays in the same conference hotel). Alternatively this attack can also be done by your ISP or the VPN service you use. My Mac runs the default macOS configuration, meaning there is no proxy, custom DNS or VPN set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up an attack like this is surprisingly easy using publicly available tools that are designed to do automatic SSL Stripping, ARP pollution and replacing of content of various requests. If you’ve done it before, it will take less than an hour to set everything up on any computer, including a Raspberry Pi, which I used for my research. The total costs for the whole attack is therefore less than $50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_10.jpg&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to publish the names of all the tools I used, nor the code I wrote. You might want to look into well-known tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/&quot;&gt;sslstrip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitmproxy.org/&quot;&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireshark.org/&quot;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-arbitrary-code-on-the-developers-machine&quot;&gt;Running arbitrary code on the developer’s machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous example injected malicious code into the iOS app using a hijacked SDK. Another attack vector is the developer’s Mac. Once an attacker can run code on your machine, and maybe even has remote SSH access, the damage could be significant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Activate remote SSH access for the admin account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install keylogger to get admin password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decrypt the keychain using the password, and send all credentials to remote server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access local secrets, like AWS credentials, CocoaPods &amp;amp; RubyGems push tokens and more
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If a developer now has a popular CocoaPod, you can spread more malicious code through their SDKs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access literally any file and database on your Mac, including iMessage conversations, emails and source code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record the user’s screen without them knowing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install a new root SSL certificate, allowing the attacker to intercept most of your encrypted network requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove that this is working, I looked into how to inject malicious code in a shell script developers run locally, in this case BuddyBuild:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Same requirements as in the previous example, attacker needs to be in the same network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BuddyBuild docs told users to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; an unencrypted URL piping the content over to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt;, meaning any code the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command returns will be executed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The modified &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UpdateSDK&lt;/code&gt; is provided by the attacker (Raspberry PI), and asks for the admin password (normally BuddyBuild’s update script doesn’t ask for this)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Within under a second, the malicious script does the following
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enable SSH remote access for the current account&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Install &amp;amp; setup a keylogger that auto-starts when you login&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the attacker has the root password and SSH access, they can do anything listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/N1Wj6ipc-HU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BuddyBuild resolved the issue after reporting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-realistic-is-such-an-attack&quot;&gt;How realistic is such an attack?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very!&lt;/strong&gt; Open your Network settings on the Mac, and take a look at the list of WiFi networks your Mac was connected to. In my case, my MacBook was connected to over 200 hotspots. How many of them can you fully trust? Even in a trustworthy network, there could still be other machines that got hacked previously which are doing remote controlled attacks (see section above)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDKs and developer tools become more and more a target for attackers. Some examples from the past years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XcodeGhost&quot;&gt;Xcode Ghost&lt;/a&gt; affected about 4,000 iOS apps, including WeChat:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Attacker gains remote access to any phone running the app&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Show phishing popups&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Access and modify the clipboard (dangerous when using password managers)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/pegasus-spyware/14604/&quot;&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;: malware for non-jailbroken iPhones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/&quot;&gt;used by governments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeyRaider&quot;&gt;KeyRaider&lt;/a&gt;: Only affected jailbroken iPhones, but still stole user-credentials from over 200,000 end-users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just the last few weeks, there have been multiple posts about how this affects web projects also (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/protect-site-from-cyrptojacking-csp-sri/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Malware_for_iOS&quot;&gt;and many, many more&lt;/a&gt;. Another approach is getting access to the download server (e.g. S3 bucket using access keys) and replacing the binary. This happened multiple times in the past few years, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/07/transmission-malware-downloaded-6500-times/&quot;&gt;Transmission Mac app incident&lt;/a&gt;. This opens a whole new level of area of attack, which I didn’t cover in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conferences-hotels-coffee-shops&quot;&gt;Conferences, hotels, coffee shops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you connect to the WiFi at a conference, hotel or coffee shop, you become an easy target. Attackers know that there is a high number of developers during conferences and can easily make use of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-sdk-providers-protect-their-users&quot;&gt;How can SDK providers protect their users?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would go out of scope for this blog post. Mozilla offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security&quot;&gt;security guide&lt;/a&gt; that’s a good starting point. Mozilla provides a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;[https://observatory.mozilla.org](https://observatory.mozilla.org)&quot;&gt;observatory&lt;/a&gt; that will do some automatic checks of the server settings and certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-many-of-the-most-popular-sdks-are-affected-by-this-vulnerability&quot;&gt;How many of the most popular SDKs are affected by this vulnerability?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; width: 340px;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/trusting-sdks/image_13.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While doing this research starting on 23rd November 2017, I investigated 41 of the most popular mobile SDKs according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appsight.io/?asot=2&amp;amp;o=top&amp;amp;os=ios&quot;&gt;AppSight&lt;/a&gt; (counting all Facebook and Google SDKs as one, as they share the same installation method - skipping SDKs that are open source on GitHub)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41&lt;/strong&gt; SDKs checked
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt; are closed source and you can only download binary files&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt; of those are open source (all of them on GitHub)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; are an easy target of person-in-the-middle attacks without any indication to the user
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; of them are closed source SDKs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; of them are open source SDKs, meaning the user can either download the SDK via unencrypted HTTP from the official website, or securely clone the source code from GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; of the 41 SDKs offer no way to download the SDK securely, meaning they don’t support any HTTPs at all, nor use a service that does (e.g. GitHub)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt; of the top used SDKs are easy targets for this attack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; additional SDKs required an account to download the SDK (do they have something to hide?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notified all affected in November/December 2017, giving them 2 months to resolve the issue before publicly talking about it. Out of the 13 affected SDKs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; resolved the issue within three business days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; resolved the issue within a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; SDKs are still vulnerable to this attack at the time of publishing this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDK providers that are still affected haven’t responded to my emails, or just replied with “We’re gonna look into this” - all of them in the top 50 most most-used SDKs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking through the available CocoaPods, there are a total of &lt;strong&gt;4,800&lt;/strong&gt; releases affected, from a total of &lt;strong&gt;623&lt;/strong&gt; CocoaPods. I generated this data locally using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Specs&lt;/code&gt; repo with the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grep -l -r '&quot;http&quot;: &quot;http://' *&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source-vs-closed-source&quot;&gt;Open Source vs Closed Source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking the number above, you are much likely to be affected by attacks if you use closed source SDKs. More importantly: When an SDK is closed source, it’s much harder for you to verify the integrity of the dependency. As you probably know, you should always &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control&quot;&gt;check the Pods directory into version control&lt;/a&gt;, to detect changes and be able to audit your dependency updates. 100% of the open source SDKs I investigated can be used directly from GitHub, meaning even the 3 SDKs affected are not actually affected if you make sure to use the version on GitHub instead of taking it from the provider’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the numbers above it is clear that in addition to not being able to dive into the source code for closed source SDKs you also have a much higher risk of being attacked. Not only person-in-the-middle attacks, but also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The attacker gains access to the SDK download server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The company providing the SDK gets compromised&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The local government forces the company to include back-doors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The company providing the SDK is evil and includes code &amp;amp; tracking you don’t want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are responsible for the binaries you ship!&lt;/strong&gt; You have to make sure you don’t break your user’s trust, European Union data protection laws (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eugdpr.org/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;) or steal the user’s credentials via a malicious SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, it’s our responsibility to make sure we only ship code we trust. One of the easiest attack vectors right now is via malicious SDKs. If an SDK is open source, hosted on GitHub, and is installed via CocoaPods, you’re pretty safe. Be extra careful with bundling closed-source binaries or SDKs you don’t fully trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this type of attack can be done with little trace, you will not be able to easily find if your codebase is affected. By using open source code, we as developers can better protect ourselves, and with it, our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any Mac app, sandboxed or not sandboxed can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take screenshots of your Mac silently without you knowing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access every pixel, even if the Mac app is in the background&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use basic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition&quot;&gt;OCR software&lt;/a&gt; to read the text on the screen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access all connected monitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-worst-that-could-happen&quot;&gt;What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read password and keys from password managers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detect what web services you use (e.g. email provider)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read all emails and messages you open on your Mac&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a developer is targeted, this allows the attacker to potentially access sensitive source code, API keys or similar data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn personal information about the user, like their bank details, salary, address, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is a proof of concept and should not be used in production. The goal is to highlight a privacy loophole that can be abused by Mac apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-protect-myself-as-a-user&quot;&gt;How can I protect myself as a user?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge there is no way to protect yourself as of now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposal&quot;&gt;Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of valid use-cases for Mac apps to record the screen, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/&quot;&gt;1Password 2fA support&lt;/a&gt;, screen recording software or even simple screen sharing via your web browser or Skype. However there must be some kind of control:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The App Store review process could verify the Sandbox entitlements for accessing the screen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the user in charge with a permission dialog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additionally the user should be notified whenever an app accesses the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5610698700750848&quot;&gt;filed a radar&lt;/a&gt; (rdar://37423927) to notify Apple about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A developer just needs to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CGWindowListCreateImage&lt;/code&gt; to generate a capture of the complete screen within an instant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CGImageRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screenshot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CGWindowListCreateImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CGRectInfinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kCGWindowListOptionOnScreenOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kCGNullWindowID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kCGWindowImageDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;NSBitmapImageRep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bitmapRep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;NSBitmapImageRep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initWithCGImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:screenshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experiments, I piped the generated image over to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition&quot;&gt;OCR library&lt;/a&gt; and was able to get all text that was rendered on the user’s machine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="mac" /><category term="screenshot" /><category term="privacy" /><summary type="html">Facts</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing Overkill - Don’t let iTunes interrupt your workflow</title><link href="https://krausefx.github.io/krausefx.com//blog/introducing-overkill-dont-let-itunes-interrupt-your-workflow" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Overkill - Don't let iTunes interrupt your workflow" /><published>2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://krausefx.github.io/krausefx.com//blog/introducing-overkill-dont-let-itunes-interrupt-your-workflow</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://krausefx.github.io/krausefx.com//blog/introducing-overkill-dont-let-itunes-interrupt-your-workflow">&lt;p&gt;Exactly one year after the initial launch of Overkill as a shell script, after being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/overkill&quot;&gt;#1 on ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt;, I’m extremely excited to announce that &lt;strong&gt;Overkill is now a native Mac app&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did iTunes ever launch without you opening it? Use Overkill to instantly kill the iTunes process once it opened itself, so your workflow isn’t interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #888; margin-left: 20px&quot;&gt;But Felix, you can use the check box to not launch iTunes when you connect your phone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is correct, but connecting a device to your Mac is only one of the many reasons when iTunes can’t wait to spread joy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You click the play/pause key while listening to a web-based music player (e.g. SoundCloud, YouTube)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Someone sent you a link to an iOS app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You click on a link on the web, and didn’t expect it to be a Music link&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You updated iTunes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You launch iTunes by clicking on the icon by mistake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You open a video/music file in Finder, and forgot to change the default app to VLC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You connect Bluetooth headphones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-overkill&quot;&gt;Before Overkill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;670&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/4kn-HefqjXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the video above, iTunes would launch while you’re typing something, stealing the window focus, and making this sound we all love to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;with-overkill&quot;&gt;With Overkill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;670&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Uk2oEKMC2_k&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Overkill, you connect your iPhone to charge it, and you can still use your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-overkill-for-mac&quot;&gt;Introducing Overkill for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overkill is a simple, elegant Mac app, that runs in the background and makes sure iTunes never interrupts your work. 
And for those movie nights where you actually want to use iTunes, just click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Pause Overkill&lt;/code&gt; and enjoy the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/overkill.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have other apps you don’t want to launch automatically (e.g. Photos app), you can add those apps to the Overkill list as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No installation required, just download Overkill from the link below, double click the Overkill icon, and you’re good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 35px; margin-bottom: 50px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/overkill-for-mac/releases/download/1.0/Overkill.zip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: #60A74E !important; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;
    Download Overkill Mac App
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I couldn’t submit Overkill to the Mac App Store, as the sandboxing doesn’t allow the termination of other processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Runs silently in the background, and kills iTunes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easily pause Overkill if you want to use iTunes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for both Dark and Light mode of the menu bar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports auto start&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports any Mac app, e.g. add the Photos app to be killed also&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No CPU usage, no polling, no analytics, just 300 lines of native Mac code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as most of the project I work on, Overkill is 100% open source under the MIT license:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often are you on the run, or hanging out with friends, only to suddenly think of this really important thing you need to do when you’re back home or back at work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to jot down that thought as quickly as possible so you don’t forget, and you want to be reminded whenever you’re back on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-major-key-the-best-key&quot;&gt;Introducing Major Key, the best key&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With far less than 100 lines of Swift code, this simple app does all you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlock phone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch Major Key 🔑&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type the note&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a second you’ll have the note in your email inbox. Extremely useful if you follow the inbox zero approach. All with no waiting times or animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch the app, write down a note, hit the 🔑 button and immediately have the note in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-new-app&quot;&gt;Why a new app?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using any kind of &lt;strong&gt;Notes app&lt;/strong&gt; works rather nicely, however involves overhead, and chances are you forget on checking the notes app when you’re back on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sending yourself an &lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt; with any email client involves extra work, as you need to start typing your email, and you get to see your inbox (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/17/compose-is-a-distraction-free-email-app-that-only-lets-you-write-messages/&quot;&gt;similar idea&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;IFTTT Notes app&lt;/strong&gt; was perfect, however it was discontinued, and the &lt;strong&gt;new IFTTT&lt;/strong&gt; app causes problems on the iPhone X due to abusing Web Clips to make it work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔑 Major Key is not available in the App Store, but is open source, and super easy to install if you’re a developer. If interest is there, I could also publish the app to the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you grant an app access to your camera, it can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;access both the front and the back camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;record you at any time the app is in the foreground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take pictures and videos without telling you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upload the pictures/videos it takes immediately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;run real-time face recognition to detect facial features or expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used a social media app while using the bathroom? 🚽&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All without indicating that your phone is recording you and your surrounding, no LEDs, no light or any other kind of indication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is a proof of concept and should not be used in production. The goal is to highlight a privacy loophole that can be abused by iOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-an-ios-app-do&quot;&gt;What can an iOS app do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS users often grant camera access to an app soon after they download it (e.g. to add an avatar or send a photo). These apps, like a messaging app or any news-feed-based app, can easily track the users face, take pictures, or live stream the front and back camera, without the user’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get full access to the front and back camera of an iPhone/iPad any time your app is running in the foreground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the front and the back camera to know what your user is doing right now and where the user is located based on image data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload random frames of the video stream to your web service, and run a proper face recognition software, which enables you to
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Find existing photos of the person on the internet&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Learn how the user looks like and create a 3d model of the user’s face&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live stream their camera onto the internet (e.g. while they sit on the toilet), with the recent innovation around faster internet connections, faster processors and more efficient video codecs it’s hard to detect for the average user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimate the mood of the user based on what you show in your app (e.g. news feed of your app)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detect if the user is on their phone alone, or watching together with a second person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording stunning video material from bathrooms around the world, using both the front and the back camera, while the user scrolls through a social feed or plays a game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the new built-in iOS 11 Vision framework, every developer can very easily parse facial features in real-time like the eyes, mouth, and the face frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-protect-myself-as-a-user&quot;&gt;How can I protect myself as a user?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only a few things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only real safe way to protect yourself is using camera covers: There is many different covers available, find one that looks nice for you, or use a sticky note (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Original-Webcam-Cover-directly-Manufacturer/dp/B01LWS2X8I&quot;&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can revoke camera access for all apps, always use the built-in camera app, and use the image picker of each app to select the photo (which will cause you to run into a problem I described with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krausefx/detect.location&quot;&gt;detect.location&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To avoid this as well, the best way is to use Copy &amp;amp; Paste to paste the screenshot into your messaging application. If an app has no copy &amp;amp; paste support, you’ll have to either expose your image library, or your camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that many people cover their camera, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/technology/personaltech/mark-zuckerberg-covers-his-laptop-camera-you-should-consider-it-too.html&quot;&gt;including Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposal&quot;&gt;Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can the root of the problem be fixed, so we don’t have to use camera covers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer a way to grant temporary access to the camera (e.g. to take and share one picture with a friend on a messaging app), related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krausefx/detect.location&quot;&gt;detect.location&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show an icon in the status bar that the camera is active, and force the status bar to be visible whenever an app accesses the camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add an LED to the iPhone’s camera (both sides) that can’t be worked around by sandboxed apps, which is the elegant solution that the MacBook uses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reported the issue to Apple with &lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5007947352506368&quot;&gt;rdar://35116272&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot; style=&quot;width: 250px; float: right;margin: 20px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-demo&quot;&gt;About the demo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t submit the demo to the App Store; however, you can very easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/watch.user&quot;&gt;clone the repo&lt;/a&gt; and run it on your own device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You first have to take a picture that gets “posted” on the fake “social network” in the app
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At this point, you’ve granted full access to both of your cameras every time the app is running&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You browse through a news feed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After a bit of scrolling, you’ll suddenly see pictures of yourself, taken a few seconds ago while you scrolled through the feed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You realize you’ve been recorded the whole time, and with it, the app ran a face recognition algorithm to detect facial features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oh, obviously, I never grant camera permissions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/watch-user-screenshot.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 250px; float: right; border: 2px solid #BBB; margin: 10px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re using a messaging service, like Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram or anything else, chances are high you already granted permission to access both your image library (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location&quot;&gt;detect.location&lt;/a&gt;) and your camera. You can check which apps have access to your cameras and photo library by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full source code is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/watch.user&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-the-demo-app-get-access-to-the-camera&quot;&gt;How does the demo app get access to the camera?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you take and post one picture or video via a social network app, you grant full access to the camera, and any time the app is running, the app can use the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-screenshot-on-the-right&quot;&gt;What’s the screenshot on the right&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of iOS 11, there is now an easy to use Vision framework, that allows developers to easily track faces. The screenshot shows that it’s possible to get some basic emotions right, so I wrote a very basic mapping of a user’s face to the corresponding emoji as a proof of concept. You can see the highlighted facial features, and the detected emoji at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

Just ask your users politely, they’ll probably just hand over their credentials, as they’re trained to do so 👌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59dc97a83e00bed1b42c0096_1507631710330__img.png_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59dca223197aeaa9a5932f2e_1507631701259__img.png_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a proof of concept, phishing attacks are illegal! Don’t use this in any of your apps. The goal of this blog post is to close the loophole that has been there for many years, and hasn’t been addressed yet. For moral reasons, I decided not to include the actual source code of the popup, however it was shockingly easy to replicate the system dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-this-work&quot;&gt;Why does this work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS asks the user for their iTunes password for many reasons, the most common ones are recently installed iOS operating system updates, or iOS apps that are stuck during installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, users are trained to just enter their Apple ID password whenever iOS prompts you to do so. However, those popups are not only shown on the lock screen, and the home screen, but also inside random apps, e.g. when they want to access iCloud, GameCenter or In-App-Purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could easily be abused by any app, just by showing an UIAlertController, that looks exactly like the system dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even users who know a lot about technology have a hard time detecting that those alerts are phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-protect-yourself&quot;&gt;How can you protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hit the home button, and see if the app quits:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If it closes the app, and with it the dialog, then this was a phishing attack&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the dialog and the app are still visible, then it’s a system dialog. The reason for that is that the system dialogs run on a different process, and not as part of any iOS app.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t enter your credentials into a popup, instead, dismiss it, and open the Settings app manually. This is the same concept, like you should never click on links on emails, but instead open the website manually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you hit the Cancel button on a dialog, the app still gets access to the content of the password field. Even after entering the first characters, the app probably already has your password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought, faking those alerts requires the app developer to know your email. Turns out, some of those auth popups don’t include the email address, making it even easier for phishing apps to ask for the password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59dca2accf81e0c47e1e7144_1507631811313__img.png_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposal&quot;&gt;Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern web browsers already do an excellent job protecting users from phishing attacks. Phishing within mobile apps is a rather new concept, and therefore still pretty unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When asking for the Apple ID from the user, instead of asking for the password directly, ask them to open the settings app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix the root of the problem, users shouldn’t constantly be asked for their credentials. It doesn’t affect all users, but I myself had this issue for many months, until it randomly disappeared.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dialogs from apps could contain the app icon on the top right of the dialog, to indicate an app is asking you, and not the system. This approach is used by push notifications also, this way, an app can’t just send push notifications as the iTunes app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59dca405c534a5f23644c180_1507632212491__img.jpg_&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; class=&quot;inline-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve reported this as a radar, which you can dupe: &lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4952345645416448&quot;&gt;rdar://34885659&lt;/a&gt; 👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes iOS shows the following notification on the lock screen, which opens up the iCloud Settings screen, this is a much better approach than to ask for the password directly: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing a dialog that looks just like a system popup is super easy, there is no magic or secret code involved, it’s literally the examples provided in the Apple docs, with a custom text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to open source the actual popup code, however, note that it’s less than 30 lines of code and every iOS engineer will be able to quickly build their own phishing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qa&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if everybody read this before posting a comment on HackerNews/Reddit #oneCanDream :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-i-have-2-factor-enabled-im-safe-right&quot;&gt;But, I have 2-factor enabled, I’m safe, right?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good for you, everybody should use 2-step verification obviously, however many people don’t. At the same time, even if your Apple account is 2FA protected, many users still use the same username/password combination on most web services, meaning if hackers know your Apple ID password, chances are high, they’re gonna try the same combination on other common services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, even with 2FA enabled accounts, what if the app asked you for your 2 step code? Most users would gladly request a 2FA-token and ask for it, and directly pipe it over to a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple-would-never-accept-such-an-app-right&quot;&gt;Apple would never accept such an app, right?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is doing a great job protecting users from dangerous third party apps, that’s why the App Store is built and provided like it is, that’s why we code sign our application (
&lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.com/blog/the-developer-part-of-ios-code-signing-doesnt-add-any-security-to-anything&quot;&gt;not really, but kind of&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s rather easy to run certain code only after the app is approved, those are not new ideas, but just to give you some ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use remote code (which is not allowed by itself, except for JavaScript), React Native or a custom JS bridge is your friend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the iTunes search API to compare the current version number with the App Store version number (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=com.Facebook.Facebook&quot;&gt;example request&lt;/a&gt;), this way the app can automatically enable malicious code after it got approved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a remote configuration tool to enable a feature only after an app is approved by Apple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a time-based trigger: just skip running certain code for the first week after submitting the binary, meaning the code will only run once the app is either approved or rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/23/15399438/apple-uber-app-store-fingerprint-program-tim-cook-travis-kalanick&quot;&gt;Pull an Uber and don’t run certain code when the location is near Cupertino&lt;/a&gt; (it’s probably fixed by Apple by now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things above is public knowledge, most iOS developers are aware, and I strongly advise against using any of this, Apple will eventually catch you and block your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this list is: While the review process provides a basic safety filter, organisations with bad intent will always find a way to somehow work around the limitations of a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phishing-on-mobile-is-that-a-thing-now&quot;&gt;Phishing on mobile? Is that a thing now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area will become more and more relevant, with users being uninformed, and the mobile operating systems not yet clearly separating system UI and app UI. This is kind of related to 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location&quot;&gt;detect.location&lt;/a&gt;, where apps would write their own, custom image picker to provide a better “experience”, but in reality, with that, they also get full access to your image library, and optionally also your camera (related to 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/watch.user&quot;&gt;watch.user&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS should very clearly distinguish between system UI and app UI elements, so that ideally it’s even obvious for the average smartphone user that something seems off. This is a tricky problem to solve, and web browser are still tackling it, you still have websites that make popups look like macOS / iOS popups, so that many users think it’s a system message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59dca2ebf14aa1f26de959f6_1507631870942__img.jpg_&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; class=&quot;inline-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-but-but-why-is-the-symbol-within-the--is-this-all-fake&quot;&gt;But, but, but, why is the . symbol within the “, is this all fake?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, actually, that’s how the system dialog looks like, the . is within the “string notation, so I designed the phishing dialog to also include the same style.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you want to know your user’s movements over the last several years, including what cities they’ve visited, which iPhones they’ve owned and how they travel? Do you want all of that data in less a second? Then this project is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59db4461cf81e005db7a2062_1507542261614_Screenshot+2017-10-09+11.40.41.png.41.png_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59db44b8f09ca452b53663ab_1507542252323_Screenshot+2017-10-09+11.40.48.png.48.png_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see all the above with &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; data, download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/detectlocations/id1288532777?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;DetectLocations app&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-with-detectlocation&quot;&gt;What can you do with detect.location?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a history of the cities, countries, and other places a user has visited, as long as they took a picture there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the user’s place of work, by figuring out where they are from 9 to 5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a complete list of the user’s cameras and photography devices (which iPhones, Android phones, cameras) and how long they used each device&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use facial recognization to find out who the user hangs out with and who their partner is. Is the user single?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand the user’s background:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Did the user attend college? If so, which one?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Did the user recently move from the suburbs to the city?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Does the user spend a lot of time with their family?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-detectlocation&quot;&gt;What’s detect.location?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The native image picker built into iOS allows app developers to access the &lt;strong&gt;full&lt;/strong&gt; image library, with all its metadata&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the raw PHAsset object, which represents a picture or video, you also get access to the image’s metadata. This includes the location and even the speed at which the user was traveling when the picture was taken.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In particular, an app can get the following data:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The exact location of each asset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The physical speed in which the picture/video was taken (how fast did the camera move)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The camera model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The exact date + time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other exif image metadata&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With this information, you can render a route of the user’s travels, into the past for as long as they’ve had a GPS-enabled camera (like an iPhone, other smartphone, or modern point-and-shoot)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can access all of this metadata without analyzing the 
contents of the image at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&gt;coinmarketcap.com&lt;/a&gt; lists all the coins and some basic information, but not a description or tags of what each coin does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my cryptocurrency bots will send me summaries of its trading activities every day, with a list of coins and the amounts invested, however I usually was interested what those coins do, and why they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how many developers face this issue, but I decided to build and publish a side project of my side project, it’s called Crypto-Summaries and it’s available on 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/crypto-summaries&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how to use the API (for the most up to date docs, please 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KrauseFx/crypto-summaries&quot;&gt;open the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;access-the-summary-of-bitcoin&quot;&gt;Access the summary of Bitcoin:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 line summary&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/btc-1.txt&quot;&gt;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/btc-1.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 lines summary&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/btc-3.txt&quot;&gt;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/btc-3.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 lines summary&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/btc-5.txt&quot;&gt;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/btc-5.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can also use the name of the coin instead of symbol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 lines summary&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/bitcoin-3.txt&quot;&gt;https://krausefx.github.io/crypto-summaries/coins/bitcoin-3.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to have a community maintained description of crypto currencies, maybe one day even support for tags, so you could filter for e.g. gaming coins. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">While working on crypto currency automation over the last weeks, I noticed that one of the best known websites coinmarketcap.com lists all the coins and some basic information, but not a description or tags of what each coin does.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">iOS Privacy: What’s the user doing?</title><link href="https://krausefx.github.io/krausefx.com//blog/ios-privacy-whats-the-user-doing" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="iOS Privacy: What's the user doing?" /><published>2017-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://krausefx.github.io/krausefx.com//blog/ios-privacy-whats-the-user-doing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://krausefx.github.io/krausefx.com//blog/ios-privacy-whats-the-user-doing">&lt;p&gt;Modern web browsers give the user more control over what data they’re sharing with websites, for example location services and access to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I recently noticed a gap of how websites can determine the activity of the user based on the acceleration and gyro sensor built into modern smartphones, including the iPhone and Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/squarespace_images/static_545299aae4b0e9514fe30c95_54529a29e4b025a90f45cc50_59db442dcf81e005db7a1f0b_1507542072340_photo.jpg_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using that data, any website can determine if the user is using their phone while&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sitting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;standing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;walking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;driving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taking a picture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taking a selfie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lying in bed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;laying the phone on a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and probably more, including guesses if the user is actively using their phone at this moment, or even if they’re impaired by alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

When I submitted my first pull request I was scared. Scared that I’m doing something wrong. Scared that my patch wasn’t useful. Scared that other developers would make fun of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slowly worked my way up, from submitting smaller contributions to random open source projects, to then publishing my first open source library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krausefx/tsmessages&quot;&gt;TSMessages&lt;/a&gt;, to finally building and releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastlane.tools&quot;&gt;fastlane&lt;/a&gt;, an open source project that is now being used by tens of thousands of companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to encourage more people to get started contributing to open source projects, this blog post will show you how important open source software is in today’s world, and how it can help you grow as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-developers-and-companies-use-open-source-software&quot;&gt;Why developers and companies use open source software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-project-stays-alive-much-longer&quot;&gt;👴 Project stays alive much longer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often did you use a proprietary software solution, only to discover that the service is discontinued a few months after you’re fully ramped up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source projects can be more robust in regards of maintenance, because there isn’t a single company that can decide to stop working on the project. Instead you have a group of maintainers that invest time and resources into a given software. Even if nobody has access to the code repository, developers can fork the project, and push it forward. This is something that I’ve done myself multiple times for dependencies we have in fastlane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-independence-you-can-fix-problems-yourself&quot;&gt;🔧 Independence: you can fix problems yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if you use a commercial software and you run into a blocking issue with it? You’ll have to reach out to the support team, and hope they take your problem seriously and provide a fix for you. If the product was shut down, you’ll probably have no chance of getting any help at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With open source projects you are in full control over the software you run: You can dive into the source code, make changes and run those changes in your code base directly, without the original author’s approval. Even if a project is not being maintained any more, you can still not only use the open source software, but also fix issues and extend its feature sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-trust&quot;&gt;🤝 Trust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What closed source binaries do you include in your mobile app? Each of them adds a risk for your app and your users, as it adds multiple attack surfaces. You cannot tell what the binary does, it could be malicious, it could collect data you don’t want to track, it could call home without you knowing, it might have bugs causing other areas of the app to be slowed down or even crash, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&quot;&gt;man-in-the-middle attack&lt;/a&gt; might modify the binary while you download it, or the download server gets hacked as it happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XcodeGhost&quot;&gt;XcodeGhost&lt;/a&gt; just last year. A closed source binary as part of your build phase might even go as far as uploading your app’s source code, secret keys and other data from your local machine. Some of these problems also apply to open source projects, however you do have more control over them. You can fork the project, audit the code, and then periodically merge it with the upstream repository after auditing the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple approaches to fix man-in-the-middle attacks and future XcodeGhosts, like checking the code signing of the app and comparing the hashes, however you’ll never be able to tell what the binary does under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;📖 Knowledge sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source code enables every person on the planet with access to a computer and internet to read your code and learn from it. This is extremely powerful and isn’t done in a lot of areas. For example when studying physics, you’ll soon notice how many papers and critical information are hidden behind paywalls or kept secret by the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artsy is a great example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy&quot;&gt;their apps are open source&lt;/a&gt;, so when someone asks one of the engineers how they do X, they can just link to the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-open-source-build-tools&quot;&gt;🛠 Open source build tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m working on developer tooling most of the time, I’m thinking a lot about how essential they are for a team to be productive. If they don’t work, you can’t ship to your users. Being in control of your most important infrastructure pieces is crucial to making sure you’re not dependent on third parties when :poo: hits the fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter if you work on mobile apps or something else, very often there are services that promise to take all the heavy lifting for you by providing a proprietary, hosted software solution. This is great if you are starting out, however, by relying on this kind of solution you accumulate technical debt that you will have to fix in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your business critical infrastructure pieces (which includes build and deploy tools) you’ll want to have the knowledge of how they work, and ideally the opportunity to fix problems and customize the setup to fit your needs. If something doesn’t work you can dive into the code base, analyze the error, and fix the problem. This might not be as relevant for indie developers, but for bigger companies with dozens or hundred of engineers depending on the build and release process, it is important to be able to fix systems as soon as they break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-contribute-to-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Why contribute to open source projects?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using open source software is awesome, but why would you care about working on one? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-scale-of-impact&quot;&gt;📈 Scale of impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to imagine the impact you can have on developers all around the world when working on open source projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have this kind of impact, either by working on an existing open source project, or also by open sourcing some code you wrote. Who knows, it might be the next big thing :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-how-did-i-get-started-with-open-source&quot;&gt;🤔 How did I get started with open source?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I got into open source, is actually when I open sourced my first project called “TSMessages”. When I was showing my little app to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/myell0w&quot;&gt;Matthias&lt;/a&gt; at CocoaHeads in Vienna, he asked me if I can open source the custom notification bars I built. I didn’t know a lot about open source back then, but Matthias was kind enough to help me with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of release &lt;a href=&quot;https://cocoapods.org/pods/TSMessages&quot;&gt;TSMessages&lt;/a&gt; had 2 classes and less than 400 lines of code. Within the next months more and more people started using it, resulting in a total of over a million downloads. Currently the project is actively being used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cocoapods.org/pods/TSMessages&quot;&gt;13,000 apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without me having to put in extra work, I didn’t only use TSMessages for all my personal apps, but helped 13,000 other companies to show better notifications in their apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-with-fastlane&quot;&gt;Impact with fastlane&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fastlane.tools&quot;&gt;fastlane&lt;/a&gt; started as my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krausefx/evaluation_report&quot;&gt;Bachelor project&lt;/a&gt;, where I put the code on GitHub after completing the first tool deliver. One tool led to another, resulting in the fastlane umbrella tool, containing 17 standalone tools, 170 built-in actions, and 180 third party plugins. Today fastlane has saved over 9,000,000 developer hours and is used by tens of thousands of companies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never expected the project to grow this big. It started by only solving the problems I had as an iOS developer. No matter how small you think a script or tool is, it will probably help other developers out there who face the same challenges. Only 9 months after releasing the first version, fastlane joined Twitter, and I helped build a team around fastlane. Today, fastlane is a 6 person team based in San Francisco and Boston and is moving faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-career--jobs&quot;&gt;👩‍💻 Career &amp;amp; Jobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 years ago, I didn’t know a single person working at one of the big tech companies. All the tech giants were a closed bubble for me coming from Europe, I couldn’t ask someone how it is to work there, I didn’t have anyone to refer me, I didn’t know how the companies are structured. After moving to San Francisco, working for Twitter, and now Google I have a much better sense of how things work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the same position I was 2 years ago, and you’re thinking about working at Google, Facebook, or similar, one of the best ways to get in touch with someone there is to contribute to one of the company’s open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger companies that own open source projects, not always have the necessary resources to maintain all aspects of them. The organizations are happy about external maintainers, and depending on the team behind it, you might receive an email sooner or later :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-resume&quot;&gt;📃 Resume&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listing open source contributions in your CV is powerful. It shows engagement in the developer community, and that you’re potentially familiar with established tooling and frameworks in your field. Depending on your contribution, it demonstrates that you can navigate around in an existing code base, identify an issue, debug and fix problems, or extend the project’s feature set. The majority of engineers use open source software for their projects, however only a small percentage also contribute. It’s definitely a great plus point for every resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-to-sum-up&quot;&gt;👍 To sum up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn new technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve a project you use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pimp your resume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborate with people you would otherwise never work with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your code could end up being used by millions of users (literally)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet points: the maintainers might tweet about your contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many projects attribute their contributors on their website, or changelog - this has the nice side effect of boosting your personal search engine visibility also, especially if your name is common&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-started-with-open-source&quot;&gt;How to get started with open source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I got you interested in contributing to open source software, so the next question is, how do you best get started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-subscribe-to-a-repo-youre-interested-in&quot;&gt;📢 Subscribe to a repo you’re interested in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By subscribing to notifications of an open source repo, you’ll get a good sense of what the community is like, what problems the contributors are facing, and where you can jump in to help. After a few weeks of being active, you’ll get a good sense of what the community is working on and how you can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s scary submitting your first pull request to a new project. Some projects might not be looking for new contributors, so it’s a good idea to subscribe to a project before starting to contribute, so you get a feel on what the community is like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://fastlane.tools&quot;&gt;fastlane&lt;/a&gt;, we welcome all new contributors, mention every single one 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.54.1&quot;&gt;in the release notes&lt;/a&gt; by name, and after successfully getting multiple PRs merged and helping other people, we promote them to 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CORE_CONTRIBUTOR.md&quot;&gt;core contributors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of open source software that’s being used by hundreds of thousands of projects, but only have a single maintainer. Often those projects are so foundational of everything in an ecosystem, that people forget it exists. This is your chance to go through the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://libraries.io/bus-factor&quot;&gt;list of projects&lt;/a&gt; with the worst bus factor and jump in and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The “bus factor” is the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project before the project stalls due to lack of knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor&quot;&gt;Source: Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of where things went really wrong was the left-pad project, a tiny JavaScript library that was maintained by a single person, that 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/&quot;&gt;broke thousands of projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-how-to-join-the-development-team-of-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;👪 How to join the development team of open source projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becoming a core contributor of a project very much depends on the size of the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hyper-scale open source projects (e.g. Swift, React Native): It’s going to be pretty difficult to stand out, as there are hundreds of active maintainers, and it’s hard to tell how actively the owners of the repo monitor the activity of contributors. Very often, those kinds of projects have mailing lists you can join.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Projects that are popular and the go-to solution in its field (e.g. devise, CocoaPods, fastlane): Those projects are a great opportunity to have extremely high impact on other developers, while still having a rather small core development team. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low bus factor projects (see bus factor list): It’s rather easy and informal to join the development team. It’s usually enough to ping the current maintainer and ask about the plans for the project, and how you can help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many developers, the most interesting category is the second one: You can have a lot of impact within a short amount of time, get visibility and you have the chance to join a welcoming community and it’s a great opportunity to learn from fellow developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-getting-started&quot;&gt;🚀 Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s not so clear on how to get started, so here are some tips on what you can do in no specific order&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping out with an open source project is usually rather informal, often it’s enough to submit a smaller pull request&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look at some older issues and pull requests, and see if you can help get them resolved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See if there is a Slack group, Gitter or email group you can join to see what the core team talks about&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read through the documentation and guides to see if there are parts that aren’t clear and need updating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most projects at this size will have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md file&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to get started with contributing code, and helping users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There might be additional documentation on how the project is structured and where to get started&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many projects will have outdated documentation, it’s a great chance for you to get some “internet points” by improving those&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding more tests to existing projects gives you great visibility on how the project works, while at the same time making the maintainers very happy. Unit tests are often self-contained, making it easy for you to add them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subscribe to the repo to see how the community members interact with each other, and get a sense of what problems the project is facing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some projects have a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/labels/complexity%3A%20you%20can%20do%20this&quot;&gt;you-can-do-this&lt;/a&gt;”, “help-wanted” or “beginner-friendly” GitHub labels, that are usually simpler fixes with some instructions provided by the maintainers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There might be monthly video calls to align the whole development team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onboard the project from a new user’s perspective, and see if there are any rough edges you could improve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The core team might be active on social networks like Twitter, make use of them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have an idea on how you can improve the project, submit an issue first to get feedback from the core team before spending time on building it. This is especially important if it’s a new feature that will need to be maintained in the future. Don’t forget to look if an issue for this specific idea was already created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important piece is to get out there and submit pull requests, the rest will happen automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-wrapping-up&quot;&gt;🎁 Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers and companies become more and more aware of how important it is for their dependencies to be in open source, not only to see what’s happening under the hood, but also to be able to fix problems themselves or even run their own fork if needed. This is especially relevant for build and deployment tools, but also third party SDKs you ship with your app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has never been easier to get started contributing to open source, all it takes is a computer with internet access. As an engineer, it’s a great move for your career to get involved in open source communities: You have great impact outside of your usual work scope and have the chance to work with people you’d never otherwise work with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still unsure, and need help getting started with your first contribution, please send me a private message on 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KrauseFx&quot;&gt;Twitter (@KrauseFx)&lt;/a&gt;, I’m more than happy to help wherever I can 👍&lt;/p&gt;
